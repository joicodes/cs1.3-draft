# CS 1.3: Core Data Structures & Algorithms

### Course Description

This course explores the foundations of computer science including discrete mathematics, abstract data types, data structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. 

Students will implement and test data structures including lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and trees. Students will then apply these to real-world problems like phone call routing to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.


 
### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Implement, compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms
1. Analyze best-case and worst-case time and space complexity of an algorithm
1. Implement several abstract data types and data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, maps, sets, and binary search trees
1. Implement tree traversal algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first ordering
1. Write technical articles to deepen understanding and demonstrate mastery


### Prerequisites

## Assignments


### Coding Modules

Each lesson will have an associated module consisting of review, conceptual, and coding activities as well as interview prep related to the topic. At the end of each week you will turn your module work into gradescope for feedback and a score.

### Technical Article

Students will also write a technical article about a topic related to course content to deepen their understanding, improve their technical writing skills, and demonstrate mastery of computer science, which will bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.
Refer to the [technical article guidelines][] for more information about article requirements and detailed tips on how to select a topic related to computer science, research the topic, create an outline, write your article, cite all sources of borrowed material, and provide feedback to other students.

## Assignment Submissions

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.


## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required assignments (one quiz or coding module assignment can be dropped)
- Pass all assignments according to the associated assignment rubric 
- Pass all quizzes with a score 70% or higher 
- If an assignment or quiz is not passing you will have up to a week after your grade is received to retake and bring your score up to passing
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences
